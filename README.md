# MERN Lessson Scheduler

## Description

This project is a refactor of [Music Notes](https://github.com/ntjohns1/Music-Notes), an application to help music teachers easily manage their students. Users with a teacher role can remove students, send them comments, update or delete existing comments, and create events in the student users calendar. I helped build the previous version with a team as my second project at UNC Coding Bootcamp. It was originally a Restful API with mySQL on the backend and Handlebars as the view framework; I am updating it to a MERN stack application with a GraphQL API. 

## Planned Features

 * Converting the "Lesson Comments" components to a messaging service
 * Building an API to handle creating events instead of using Google Calendar API
 * Implementing GridFS so the teacher can upload A/V data
